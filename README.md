# CPSC535-SP21-Project1
Rewriting greeting cards

In this project we design and implement one algorithm related to strings.

Given a string S of length N>0, and a list of M pairs of strings LS, each pair representing a string to be replaced and the second being the actual replacement, display the new string R that is obtained by replacing every occurrence of the first string in each pair with the corresponding second string in the pair.
